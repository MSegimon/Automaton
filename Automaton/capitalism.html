					<h4>Capitalism</h4>
					<h3>Mainly based on USA</h3>
					<p>Capitalism is an economic system based upon private ownership of
						the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics
						central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation,
						wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets.
						In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment are
						determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability
						in financial and capital markets, whereas prices and the distribution
						of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods
						and services markets.</p>
					<p>Economists, political economists, sociologists and historians have
						adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and
						have recognized various forms of it in practice. These include
						laissez-faire or free market capitalism, welfare capitalism and state
						capitalism. Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of
						free markets, public ownership, obstacles to free competition and
						state-sanctioned social policies. The degree of competition in markets,
						the role of intervention and regulation, and the scope of state ownership
						vary across different models of capitalism. The extent to which
						different markets are free as well as the rules defining private property
						are matters of politics and policy. Most existing capitalist economies are
						mixed economies, which combine elements of free markets with state
						intervention and in some cases economic planning.</p>
					<p>Capitalism was carried across the world by broader processes of
						globalization and by the end of the 18th century became the dominant
						global economic system, in turn intensifying processes of economic
						and other globalization. Later in the 20th century, capitalism
						overcame a challenge by centrally-planned economies and is now the
						encompassing system worldwide, with the mixed economy being
						its dominant form in the industrialized Western world.</p>
					<p>The relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious
						area in theory and in popular political movements. The extension of
						universal adult male suffrage in 19th century Britain occurred along
						with the development of industrial capitalism and democracy became
						widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading capitalists to posit
						a causal or mutual relationship between them. However, according to
						some authors in the 20th century capitalism also accompanied a variety of
						political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including
						fascist regimes, absolute monarchies and single-party states. Democratic
						peace theory asserts that democracies seldom fight other democracies,
						but critics of that theory suggest that this may be because of political
						similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or
						capitalist. Moderate critics argue that though economic growth under
						capitalism has led to democracy in the past, it may not do so in the future
						as authoritarian regimes have been able to manage economic growth without
						making concessions to greater political freedom.</p>
